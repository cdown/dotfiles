# A bunch of home videos got converted to DVD, but they have a few problems:
#
# 1. They are 720x576, and YouTube will just downscale this to 420p. That's why
#    we use lanczos upscaling to 720p.
# 2. They have VHS interlacing. Try to fix it with yadif mode 1, which outputs
#    one frame for each field (so now 50fps 720p50).
# 3. There's a bunch of head switching noise at the bottom which makes
#    compression worse and reduces overall useful data throughput. Before I
#    used drawbox to mask it, but since we're resizing we might as well just
#    crop out the dead areas and colour artefacts with the crop filter.
#
# Other than that, just use the optimal YouTube settings (except for the audio,
# which we pass through without reencoding, since YouTube can just do whatever
# it wants with it).
