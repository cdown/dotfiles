SimpylFold

Because of its reliance on significant whitespace rather than explicit block
delimiters, properly folding Python code can be tricky. The Python syntax
definition that comes bundled with Vim doesn't contain any fold directives at
all, and the simplest workaround is to `:set foldmethod=indent`, which usually
ends up folding a lot more than you really want it to.

There's no shortage of Vim plugins for improved Python folding, but most seem
to suffer from cobbled-together algorithms with bizarre, intractable bugs in
the corner cases. SimpylFold aims to be exactly what its name suggests:
simple, correct folding for Python. It's nothing more than it needs to be: it
properly folds class and function/method definitions, and leaves your loops
and conditional blocks untouched. There's no BS involved: no screwing around
with unrelated options (which several of the other plugins do), no choice of
algorithms to scratch your head over (because there's only one that's
correct); it just works, simply.

Configuration                                              *SimpylFold-config*

There is no configuration necessary for SimpylFold to start working. Just
install it, and you're good to go!

                                                *SimpylFold_docstring_preview*

If you want to see the first line of your docstrings appear in the fold text,
set g:SimpylFold_docstring_preview to 1 in your .vimrc.

If you find any bugs, please report them and/or submit pull requests on
Github! Simple is nice, but simple and correct is much better.
